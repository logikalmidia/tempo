                <p> Tempo app is a soccer social media app where football fans can relate with each other. Our app has a forum designated 
                    for each football club. The user is entitled to pick one of the five clubs on the Tempo app and join the forum. 
                    The five clubs are; Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea, Real Madrid, and Barcelona.
                </p>

                <p>After signing up, any club you choose would be tied to your profile. Note that you won't be able to see what is going on 
                    in other clubs or forums. It is locked to only members of that particular forum. However, we give a one-time opportunity 
                    to change your club from your profile and once you've used that privilege, you're stuck with any club you choose.
                </p>

                <p>Tempo app also features a merch store where you can purchase merchandise. Another feature in the Tempo app is the news 
                    feed which enables every user to post pictures or videos of soccer matches or anything that is soccer-related. People 
                    can like and engage in others' posts. There is also a prediction page where the admin predicts a score and other users 
                    can tell their predictions and at the end, a poll is being done to figure out who won the poll.

                </p>
